                    focus on tropical forests. Studying these relationships help
                    us understand the way that forest elephants help draw down

                    Forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) are an
                    elusive subspecies of African elephants that inhabit the
                    densely wooded rainforests of west and central Africa. They
                    are found most commonly in countries with relatively large
                    blocks of dense forest such as Gabon, the Democratic
                    Republic of Congo (DRC), Cameroon and Central African
                    Republic in central Africa and Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and
                    Ghana in west Africa.

                <h2 class="text-xl">Location and Population</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Their preference for dense forest habitat prohibits
                    traditional counting methods such as visual identification.
                    Their population is usually estimated through "dung
                    counts"—an analysis of the density and distribution of the
                    feces. Forest elephants face severe threats from poaching
                    and habitat loss, causing a population reduction of over 60%
                    from 2002-2013 in central Africa.

                <h2 class="text-xl">Differences with Savanna Elephants</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Although relatives of the highly studied African savanna
                    elephant (Loxodonta africana), forest elephants are
                    different morphologically, socially, and ecologically.
                    Forest elephants are smaller than savanna elephants, the
                    other African elephant subspecies. Their ears are more
                    oval-shaped ears and their tusks are straighter and point
                    downward (the tusks of savanna elephants curve outwards).
                    There are also differences in the size and shape of the
                    skull and skeleton.

                <h2 class="text-xl">Role in the Forest</h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    All African elephants knock down trees, but forest elephants
                    help improve the rainforest in a unique way. They knock down
                    the smaller trees to let the larger ones continue to grow
                    and stay healthy. This improves the health of the forest as
                    a whole.

                    Elephants are keystone species, meaning they provide
                    ecosystem services such as seed dispersal, nutrient transfer
                    across large gradients, and habitat creation from foraging,
                    trampling, and upheaval of vegetation. However, elephants
                    are continuously poached at astounding rates; it is
                    estimated that 96 elephants are killed every day, or roughly
                    one every 15 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also recently discovered that changes in vegetation
                    structure from forest elephant disturbance have significant
                    effects on carbon stocks. Through selective browsing, seed
                    dispersal, and clearing out of the understory, forest
                    elephants promote larger trees and more carbon dense
                    forests. If elephants were to become extinct in the African
                    tropics, it is estimated that aboveground biomass would be
                    reduced by 7%. Therefore, by protecting African forest
                    elephants, you can also sequester carbon from the
                    atmosphere.
